# Machine-Learning-Assignment
As part of the college ML course, build machine learning models to predict whether a tumor is benign or malignant. <br/>
Implemented the models perceptron, fisher's linear discriminant, and logistic regression from scratch without any libraries like Sckitlearn, Tensorflow, Keras and Pytorch.
